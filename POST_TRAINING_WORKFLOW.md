# Post-Training Workflow & Customer Data Usage

## Summary: What Happens After Training

Your LLM Tuner Platform now provides a **complete end-to-end workflow** from data upload to model deployment and inference.

## Customer Data Usage - **YES, Training Uses Your Data**

### Data Processing Pipeline:
1. **Customer Upload**: Users upload training files (text, JSON, CSV, etc.)
2. **S3 Storage**: Files stored securely in user-specific S3 buckets
3. **Data Preparation**: Content converted to instruction-following format:
   ```json
   {
     "instruction": "Continue the following text:",
     "input": "First 100 characters of your text...",
     "output": "Remaining text as completion..."
   }
   ```
4. **Fine-Tuning**: Model trained on your specific data using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

### Training Configuration:
- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: Uses LoRA adapters to minimize training time and cost
- **Instruction Format**: Your data is converted to instruction-response pairs
- **User-Specific Training**: Each model is trained exclusively on the user's uploaded data

## Complete Post-Training Workflow

### 1. Training Completion
When training finishes, the system provides:
- **Model Artifacts**: Saved to S3 at `s3://bucket/users/{user_id}/models/{job_name}/`
- **Training Metrics**: Loss, accuracy, and performance data
- **Cost Tracking**: Total training cost and duration

### 2. Available Actions After Training

#### **Model Download** 
- **API**: `GET /api/model-download/{job_name}`
- **Returns**: Presigned S3 URL for direct download
- **Format**: `.tar.gz` containing model weights and configuration
- **Expiration**: 1 hour download window

#### **Model Deployment**
- **API**: `POST /api/deploy-model`
- **Action**: Creates SageMaker inference endpoint
- **Instance**: ml.g5.xlarge (default) for real-time inference
- **Cost**: ~$1.21/hour while endpoint is active

#### **Model Inference**
- **API**: `POST /api/invoke-model`
- **Function**: Generate text using your fine-tuned model
- **Input**: Any text prompt
- **Output**: Generated text based on your training data

### 3. New API Endpoints for Post-Training

```bash
# Get available actions for completed training job
GET /api/training-job-actions/{job_name}

# Download model artifacts
GET /api/model-download/{job_name}

# Deploy model to inference endpoint
POST /api/deploy-model
{
  "model_s3_uri": "s3://bucket/path/to/model.tar.gz",
  "model_name": "my-fine-tuned-model",
  "instance_type": "ml.g5.xlarge"
}

# Test the deployed model
POST /api/invoke-model
{
  "endpoint_name": "my-fine-tuned-model-endpoint",
  "input_text": "Your prompt here..."
}

# Check endpoint status
GET /api/endpoint-status/{endpoint_name}
```

## Complete User Journey

### Phase 1: Training Setup
1. User uploads training data files
2. Configures hyperparameters and selects model
3. Starts SageMaker training job
4. Monitors training progress and cost

### Phase 2: Training Execution
1. Platform converts user data to instruction format
2. Creates S3 training dataset
3. Launches SageMaker training job
4. Provides real-time status updates

### Phase 3: Post-Training Actions (NEW)
1. **Download Model**: Get model artifacts for local use
2. **Deploy Model**: Create inference endpoint for real-time predictions
3. **Test Model**: Make predictions with fine-tuned model
4. **Monitor Costs**: Track inference endpoint usage

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Security
- **User Isolation**: Each user's data stored in separate S3 paths
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: IAM roles limit access to authorized services only

### Cost Management
- **Training Cost**: $1.21-$37.69/hour depending on instance type
- **Inference Cost**: ~$1.21/hour for ml.g5.xlarge endpoint
- **Storage Cost**: ~$0.023/GB/month for S3 storage

### Model Format
- **Base Models**: Llama 2 7B/13B, FLAN-T5 XL
- **Fine-Tuning**: LoRA adapters for efficient training
- **Output Format**: HuggingFace transformers compatible
- **Deployment**: SageMaker endpoints with auto-scaling
