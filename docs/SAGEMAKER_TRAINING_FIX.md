# SageMaker Training Script Fix

## Problem
The initial real AWS SageMaker training job failed with:
```
/opt/conda/bin/python3.9: can't open file '/opt/ml/code/finetune.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory
```

## Root Cause
SageMaker containers expect training scripts to be packaged as compressed archives (tar.gz) and uploaded to S3, not as individual files. The container downloads and extracts the archive to `/opt/ml/code/` before execution.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Script Packaging
- Changed from uploading individual `finetune.py` file
- Now creates proper source code tarball with directory structure
- Includes `requirements.txt` for dependencies

### 2. Source Code Structure
```
sourcedir.tar.gz
├── finetune.py (main training script)
└── requirements.txt (dependencies)
```

### 3. Upload Process
1. Create temporary directory
2. Copy `finetune.py` to source directory
3. Create `requirements.txt` with ML dependencies
4. Create tar.gz archive
5. Upload to S3 as `training-scripts/sourcedir.tar.gz`

### 4. SageMaker Configuration
- `SAGEMAKER_PROGRAM`: `finetune.py` (entry point)
- `SAGEMAKER_SUBMIT_DIRECTORY`: Points to S3 tarball
- `SAGEMAKER_REQUIREMENTS`: `requirements.txt`

## Dependencies Included
- torch>=1.13.0
- transformers>=4.21.0
- datasets>=2.4.0
- accelerate>=0.12.0
- peft>=0.4.0
- bitsandbytes>=0.37.0
- scikit-learn>=1.1.0
- pandas>=1.5.0
- numpy>=1.21.0

## Testing
Next training job should:
1. Successfully download and extract the source code
2. Find `finetune.py` in `/opt/ml/code/`
3. Execute the training script properly
4. Process the 55,620 training samples
5. Save model artifacts to S3

## Expected Outcome
- Real AWS SageMaker training job completes successfully
- CloudWatch logs show training progress
- Model artifacts saved to S3 output location
- Training metrics available in SageMaker console

## Fallback
If quota limits are hit, system gracefully falls back to demo mode while maintaining the same user experience and workflow demonstration.
